## Todo list using express mongo and node

Make sure you have node installed. Once downloaded extract file to directory of you choice, cd into that dir and enter the command

```javascript
npm install
```
This will install all the needed modules for the project and you can choose from a couple of different scripts.
```javascript
npm start //runs node index.js
npm run devstart // runs nodemon index.js same as npm start but with server watching for changes
npm run scss // runs node-sass --output-style compressed -o public scss
npm run watch:css // runs onchange \"scss\" -- npm run scss
npm run watch:all // runs npm-run-all -p devstart watch:css
```
